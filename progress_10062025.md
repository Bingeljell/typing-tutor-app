# Typing Tutor App for Children

## Overview
The Typing Tutor App is designed to teach children how to type through engaging, age-appropriate experiences. It features two distinct modes:

1. **Fun & Friendly Mode (Ages 8 and below):** A gamified environment with bright visuals and playful mini-games to introduce keyboard basics.
2. **Literature & Pop Culture Mode (Ages 9 and above):** Lessons built around classic literature excerpts, pop-culture references, and educational trivia to reinforce typing skills and knowledge.

Both modes utilize adaptive difficulty, positive feedback loops, and progress tracking to foster skill development and motivation.

## Scope
- **Platforms:** Web application (desktop/tablet) and optional mobile version.
- **User Onboarding:** Simple setup with baseline typing assessment and age selection.
- **Content Library:** 
  - 10 core lessons per mode:
    - Fun & Friendly: letter drills, word games, mini-games (e.g., Pizza Maker, Letter Safari).
    - Literature & Pop Culture: 10 curated passages (5 classic literature, 5 modern kid-friendly pop-culture snippets).
- **Features:**
  - Adaptive difficulty algorithm.
  - Animated character guides (mascots).
  - Progress dashboard for users and parental overview.
  - Collectibles and badges.

## MVP Definition
**Deliverables for Initial Launch:**
1. **User Flow & Onboarding:**
   - Age-based mode selection.
   - Baseline typing assessment (home row accuracy and WPM).
2. **Core Lessons:**
   - Fun & Friendly Mode: 5 letter drills + 1 mini-game (Pizza Maker).
   - Literature & Pop Culture Mode: 3 passages (1 Dickens excerpt, 1 modern quote, 1 custom snippet).
3. **Feedback & Gamification:**
   - Visual and audio feedback for correct/incorrect keystrokes.
   - Badge system for lesson completion.
4. **Progress Tracking:**
   - User dashboard showing completed lessons, WPM improvement, and badges earned.
5. **Admin Content Management:**
   - Simple interface to add or update lesson content.

## Progress Summary (as of 2025-06-10)

### âœ… Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React (using Vite for fast dev environment)
- **Development Tools:** Windsurf (VS Code fork), Git + GitHub
- **Styling:** Inline styles + CSS file per component (starting simple)
- **State Management:** React `useState`, `useEffect` (basic local state for now)
