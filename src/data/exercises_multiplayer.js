          The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles 
          And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep, No more; and by a sleep to say we end 
          The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation 
          Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub: 
          For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, 
          Must give us pause—there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life.`,

          They have a certain tone or quality which is there even when he is not playing, just as a mathematician's mind has a certain 
          habit and outlook which is there even when he is not doing mathematics. In the same way a man who perseveres in doing just 
          actions gets in the end a certain quality of character. He becomes just or temperate. He has developed a virtue.`,
